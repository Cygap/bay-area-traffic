# San Francisco bay traffic events showcase

This simple app loads traffic events data from https://511.org/open-data/traffic and displays it on a customized Google Map.
You can use basic filters to show/hide the events of specific kind. There is also a possibility to filter events with the time slider to show the events which were updated after certain DateTime.
The markers are clickable, the information window is shown upon click. The markers are intentionally non-draggable.
On specified zoom-level the markers get clustered together to avoid view field cluttering.
